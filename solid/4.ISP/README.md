This project contains an implementation of a CartRepository with two packages:
* nl.oose.dea.orderservice.withoutisp contains classes and test cases without the ISP principle applied
* nl.oose.dea.orderservice.withisp contains some classes and test cases that guide you to apply the ISP

First read the sourcecode without ISP and run the test cases (comment the testcases with ISP applied to compile and run these testcases).
Second, read the test cases with ISP and (re)create the correct classes and interfaces so the unit tests all pass.

This project contains an implementation of an OrderService with two packages:

* nl.oose.dea.orderservice.withoutdip contains classes and test cases without the DIP principle applied
* nl.oose.dea.orderservice.withdip contains some classes and test cases that guide you to apply the DIP

First read the sourcecode without DIP and run the test cases (comment the testcases with DIP applied to compile and run these testcases).
Second, read the test cases with DIP and (re)create the correct classes and interfaces so the unit tests all pass.
